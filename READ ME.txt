CSB Winter 2018 Class Project

Anna Petrosky

I recently started a geometric morphometrics project looking at whether cranial shape in species of Chrotomys 
(an endemic Philippine genus of murine rodents) reflects the hypothesis that species' diets differ based on differential
habitat association. I photographed Field Museum specimens from three views and digitized landmarks using StereoMorph in R;
with the resulting landmark files and a spreadsheet of FMNH specimens from the Philippines, I tried to automate my landmark
analyses and export all figures and summaries. The huge time-saver was formatting the classifier CSV to make sure it exactly 
matched the IDs and order of the landmark files (due to specimen damage, each view set contains different specimens and 
counts; doing this by hand was a nightmare). I also had to run each analysis for all three views of the skull. Hopefully this
project will be expanded to a further 3 genera in the future.

WHAT TO DO:

1) run Prep_morpho_classifier.R
This will cut down the large FMNH spreadsheet and match it to the landmark files.

2) run morphometrics_stats.R
This will perform all analyses and send summaries and figures to approriately named directories.
